            I’m an enthusiastic <strong>Software Engineer</strong>, <strong>Game Developer</strong>, and <strong>Game Designer</strong>, originally from <strong>Venezuela</strong>, with a 
            lifelong passion for video games, eSports, and emerging technologies. My love for programming 
            began at age eight, when I hosted game servers on a sluggish connection and experimented with 
            Visual Basic and MySQL to build my first applications.
          </p>

          <p>
            I began my formal studies in Computer Science at <strong>UCF</strong>, but soon realized my true 
            passion lay in game development. That calling led me to <strong>Full Sail University</strong>, 
            where I earned a <strong>Bachelor’s in Game Development</strong> and later a <strong>Master’s in Game Design</strong>, 
            culminating in a thesis on the <strong>Video Games and Cognitive Enhancements</strong>. 
            
            During my master’s, I joined the <strong>Full Sail VR Lab</strong> under the guidance of <strong>Daniel Mapes </strong>
              a VR/AR prototyping expert and Course Director of Simulation Environments developing prototypes 
            for <strong>Advent Health</strong> and <strong>Decision Tactical</strong>, as well as 
            in-house AR/VR learning applications for Full Sail students. Our team also competed in 
            <strong> IRON Dev 2020</strong> a “cook-off” style challenge creating a VR solution to help 
            hospitals communicate during the COVID pandemic, winning “Most Innovative Solution.”
          </p>

          <p>
            After completing my master’s, I joined <strong>302 Interactive</strong>, collaborating on game 
            projects with partners like <strong>Third Time Games</strong>, <strong>Draw & Code</strong>, 
            <strong>Verse</strong>, and others. In-house at 302, I contributed to projects like <strong>Rogue Rally</strong>
             a rogue-lite kart racer set in a solarpunk-inspired world and <strong>302 Slices</strong>, where our 
            indie-dev team built a new bite-size prototype every month. Whether I was designing 
            prototypes to tackle real-world challenges or coding immersive worlds that sparked wonder, 
            I was fueled by that “Aha!” moment when ideas transformed into interactive realities. 
            I’m always seeking fresh collaborations and opportunities to push the boundaries of 
            gaming and immersive tech.
